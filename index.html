        <p>
            My name is Patrick Sn채ll and I'm currently studying to be a fullstack developer <br>
            at NBI/Handelsakademin located in Gothenburg. I'm currently 2 semesters in <br>
            and will graduate in June 2023.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm soon to be 29 years old and have spent most of my adult life as a salesman. <br>
            Due to my huge interest in the world that is IT and with the flame for sales <br>
            gradually getting extinguished, I choose to change my career path whilst time was still on my side.<br><br>
            This is my first homebrewed website, so a lot of experimenting going on but mainly this<br> website will be subject to my various interests in gaming.<br>
            Main focus will be on Heartstone.
